Based on your requirements, here's an outline of the routing and layout structure for your SvelteKit application, as well as a suggestion for the database table structure in Supabase:

Routing in SvelteKit:

## Home Page:
Route: / <br>
File: src/routes/index.svelte <br>
Layout: _layout.svelte (main layout) <br>

## User Registration Page:
Route: /register <br>
File: src/routes/register.svelte <br>
Layout: _layout.svelte (main layout) <br>

## User Login Page:
Route: /login
File: src/routes/login.svelte
Layout: _layout.svelte (main layout)

## User Dashboard:
Route: /dashboard
File: src/routes/dashboard.svelte
Layout: _layout.svelte (main layout)

## Upload Art Page:
Route: /upload
File: src/routes/upload.svelte
Layout: _layout.svelte (main layout)

## Permission Management Page:
Route: /permissions
File: src/routes/permissions.svelte
Layout: _layout.svelte (main layout)

## Admin Dashboard:
Route: /admin
File: src/routes/admin.svelte
Layout: _adminLayout.svelte (admin-specific layout)

## Layouts in SvelteKit:
_layout.svelte (main layout):

Contains the overall structure of the application, including header, footer, navigation, and shared components.
Wraps around routes accessible to all user types (registered users, admin, staff, artists).
_adminLayout.svelte (admin-specific layout):

Inherits from _layout.svelte (main layout) and adds additional admin-specific components or styles.
Wraps around routes accessible only to admin users.
Supabase Database Table Structure:

Users Table:

Fields: id, name, email, password, role
Art Table:

Fields: id, artist_id, image_url, description, created_at, updated_at
Permissions Table:

Fields: id, user_id, route, can_access
In the Users table, the role field can be used to differentiate between admin, staff, and artist users. The Art table stores the uploaded art information, including the associated artist's ID. The Permissions table maintains the user permissions, mapping each user to a specific route and indicating whether they have access (can_access field).

Please note that this is a basic structure and can be further expanded based on your specific requirements. Additionally, consider implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to different pages and manage user permissions effectively.
